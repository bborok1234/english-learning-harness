## Operating Rule

Issues are hypotheses. Each issue must close with one decision:

- continue
- split
- pivot
- kill
- research

See `docs/ADAPTIVE-EXECUTION-PLAN.md`.

## Next Execution

#11 is complete but was closed by direct commit `204dbec`, not by PR. That is now treated as a process gap.

M1 execution issues #11-#17 are complete. M1 milestone is closed.

| #26 | M2-2: Add due review queue command and phrase vault | continue |
| #27 | M2-3: Make scenario planner use memory and review needs | continue |
| #28 | M2-4: Enforce tutor policy with rubric smoke tests | continue |
| #29 | M2-5: Generate weekly mirror from local evidence | continue |

M2 execution issues #25-#29 are complete. M2 milestone is closed.

## M3 Daily Return Experience

| Issue | Work | Default Decision |

## M5 Real Learning Validation

| Issue | Work | Default Decision |
|---|---|---|
| #9 | E9: Seven-day validation protocol | split |
| #62 | M5-1: Define seven-day validation protocol | continue |
| #63 | M5-2: Export seven-day pilot evidence pack | continue |

## M6 Public Clone-to-Learn Release

| Issue | Work | Default Decision |
|---|---|---|
| #10 | E10: Public onboarding and distribution | split |
| #72 | M6-1: Verify public clean clone setup path | research |
| #73 | M6-2: Verify marketplace packaging and install docs | continue |
| #74 | M6-3: Harden first-run onboarding and support diagnostics | continue |
| #75 | M6-4: Close public clone-to-learn release gate | continue |
| #78 | M6-D: Decide repository visibility for public clone-to-learn | research |

Current implementation target:

```bash
gh issue view 78
```

M6 remains open. Epic #10 has been split into executable issues #72-#75, and #78 now blocks the public clone claim because the repository is currently private.

#72 evidence currently shows:

- authenticated clone mechanics pass with `ENGLISH_LEARNING_ALLOW_PRIVATE_CLONE_SMOKE=1 node scripts/phase6-public-clean-clone-smoke.mjs`.
- default public clone smoke fails by design while repository visibility is `PRIVATE`.
- public-facing clone-to-learn readiness cannot be claimed until #78 is resolved.

#73 evidence currently shows:

- clean clone can package a local marketplace root with `scripts/package-local-marketplace.mjs`.
- isolated `CODEX_HOME` can add that marketplace and install `english-learning-harness@phase6-marketplace`.
- README explicitly keeps public Git-backed install unverified and avoids unsupported URL/GitHub install commands.
